## S38_FlexibleCalendar
Confirmed operation: MacOS 10.14.6 / Xcode 11.3.1

Display an one-month calendar. The latest version of a series of making calendars that started with Objective-C. As an additional feature, the calendar size is scaled up or down as the window size changes. And I reviewed the design to reduce a number of classes, and aimed for concise and easy-to-understand code.
